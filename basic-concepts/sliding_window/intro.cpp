// Sliding Window in C++
/*Sliding window is a technique used to reduce the time complexity of problems involving arrays or strings, especially when dealing with contiguous subarrays or substrings.*/

/* When to Use it?
- When the problem asks for max/min/sum/average over a subarray of fixed or variable size.
- Instead of recalculating from scratch every time, we slide a window and reuse previous computations.
