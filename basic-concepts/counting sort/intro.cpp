What is Counting Sort? 

Counting sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that works well when:
- The elements are integers (or can be mapped to integers).
- The range of input values (max - min) is not too large compared to the number of elements.
It counts the number of occurrences of each element and then reconstructs the sorted array.
