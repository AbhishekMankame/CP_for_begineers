// Stack Introduction
// A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure - the last element added is the first one to be removed.
// Think of it like a stack of plates 🍽️ - you add to the top, and remove from the top.

// Common Operations:
/*push(x) --> Add x tp the top --> O(1)
pop() --> Remove the top element --> O(1)
top() / peek() --> View the top element without removing --> O(1)
empty() --> Check if stack is empty --> O(1)
size() --> Get the number of elements --> O(1)
