// Leetcode 3681 - Maximum XOR of Subsequence
// Hard

/*
You are given an integer array 'nums' of length 'n' where each element is a non-negative integer.

Select two subsequence of 'nums' (they may be empty and are allowed to overlap), each preserving the original order of elements, and let:
- X be the bitwise XOR of all elements in the first subsequence.
- Y be the bitwise XOR of all elements in the second subsequence.

Return the maximum possible value of 'X XOR Y'.

Note: The XOR of an empty subsequence is 0.
