/*
What is Sorting?
Sorting algorithm take unsorted array in random order, and output that number in increasing order or in decreasing order.

Example:
Unsorted Array
a = {10, 12, 5, 4, 1, 3, 2};

Sorted Array in Increasing Order
a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12}

Sorted Array in Decreasing Order
a = {12, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}

Bubble Sort
Key Idea: Take larger element to the end by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements.
It is inspired by forming of bubbles when we heat the water.

Observation: In order to swap n elements, simply put n-1 elements to the right (top), then the one element will be left here, which will be automatically the smallest
