// Sliding Window Technique

/*
Sliding window technique is a method used to solve problems that involve subarray or substring or window.
- Instead of repeatedly iterating over the same elements. the sliding window maintains a range (or "window") that moves step-by-step through data, updating results incrementally.
- The main idea is to use the results of previous window to do computations for the next window.
