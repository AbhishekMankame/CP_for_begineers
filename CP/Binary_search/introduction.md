## Binary Search
Binary Search is a highly efficient algorithm for finding the position of a target element within a sorted dataset.<br>
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target is found or the interval is empty.<br>

Time Complexity: O(log n), as the search space is halved at each step.<br>
Space Complexity: O(1)
