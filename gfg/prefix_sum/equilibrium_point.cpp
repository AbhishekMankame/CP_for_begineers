// Equilibrium index of an array using prefix-sum:

/*Here the idea is to take the prefix sum of the array twice. Once from the front end of the array and antoher from the back end of the array.
After taking both prefix sums run a loop and check for some i if both the prefix sum from one array is equal to prefix sum from the second array then that point can be considered as the Equilibrium point.
