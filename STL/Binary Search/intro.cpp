/*
Binary Search --> It is a searching algorithm that finds the position of any element in a sorted array in logarithmic time.
- It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half.
- Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half.
- Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.
