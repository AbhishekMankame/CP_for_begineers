// Subarray

/*
Note: Hard problems feel easy only after patterns become automatic.
So my goal is to make subarray patterns automatic in my brain.

What is subarray?
- A subarray is a continuous part of an array.

Eg: Array = [1,2,3]
Subarrays: [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [2,3], [1,2,3]
If it breaks continuously, then it is NOT a subarray.

Very very important (Golden Rule): If it's a subarray problem, indices are continuous --> think sliding window or prefix sum
