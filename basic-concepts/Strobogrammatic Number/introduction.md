# ðŸ”„Storbogrammatic Number - What is it?

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same way when rotated 180 degrees (upside down).
<br>Think of writing a number on paper, rotating the paper 180 degrees, and the number still looks the same.

## âœ…Valid Digits

Only certain digits remain valid (or transform into another valid digit) when rotated 180 degree:
| Original Digit | Rotated Digit |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 6 | 9 |
| 8 | 8 |
| 9 | 6 |

All the other digits (like 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7) break the strobogrammatic property, because they don't look like valid digits when rotated.
