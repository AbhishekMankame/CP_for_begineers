1.1 Cartesion Coordinate System

In CP geometry, all objects are placed on a 2-dimensional Cartesion plane.
Each position on this plane is represented by a point, which is defined by two real numbers: an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate.
The x-coordinate represents horizontal movement (left or right), while the y-coordinate represents vertical movement (up or down).

For example, the point P(2,3) lies in 2 units to the right of the origin and 3 units above it.
