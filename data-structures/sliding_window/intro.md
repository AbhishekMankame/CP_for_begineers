## Sliding Window Technique
Sliding window technique is a method used to solve problems that involve subarray or substring or window.
- Instead of repeatedly iterating over the same elements, the sliding window maintains a range (or "window") that moves step-by-step through the data, updating results incrementlly.
- The main idea is to use the results of previous window to do computations for the next window.
- Commonly used for problems like finding subarrays with a specific sum, finding the longest substring with unique characters, or solving problems that require a fixed-size window to process elements efficiently.
