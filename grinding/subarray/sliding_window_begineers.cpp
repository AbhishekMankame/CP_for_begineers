Sliding Window 
It is an algorithmic technique used to efficiently process contiguous subarrays or substrings by maintaining a window of elements that moves forward step by step, instead of recomputing results from scratch for each position.
It reduces time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) in many problems.

When to use Sliding Window
Use sliding window when:
- The problem involves subarray/substring
- Elements must be contiguous
- You need:
    - Maximum/minimum
    - sum/average
    - length/count
    - constraints like at most k, exactly k, no repeating
Do not use sliding window if elements are not contiguous
