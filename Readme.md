# 📚Competitive Programming for Begineers
Welcome to Competitive Programming for Begineers!🚀 This reopsitory is a begineer friendly guide to help you dive into the exciting world of competitive programming. I created this to share what I learn along the way, and hopefully help others who are also just starting out!

## What is Competitive Programming?
- Many people competing to 
    - Write the code that gets executed fastest
    - Write the code that uses minimum resources
    - Do this faster than others

## How is Competitive Programming Useful?
- <b>Enhances Problem-Solving</b> - Boosts logical and analytical thinking.
- <b>Deepens Algorithmic Knowledge</b> - Improves understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- <b>Builds Coding Efficiency</b> - Encourages writing clean, optimized code.
- <b>Prepares for Interviews</b> - Sharpens skills for tech interviews and real-world challenges.
- <b>Improves Debugging</b> - Trains you to fix issues quickly.
- <b>Encourages Networking</b> - Connect with like-minded coders.
- <b> Sharpens Mental Agility</b> - Speend and accuracy under pressure.

### Code Judgements
- **AC (Accepted)** - The solution is correct, and all test cases passed.
- **WA (Wrong Answer)** - The solution produced an incorrect result at least one test case.
- **TLE (Time Limited Exceeded)** - The solution exceeded the allowed time limit for at least once test case.
- **MLE (Memory Limited Exceeded)** - The solution used more memory than allowed for atleast one test case.
- **RTE (Runtime Error)** - The solution encountered an error during execution (e.g., segmentation fault, division by zero)
- **CE (Compilation Error)** - The code failed to compile.
- **IE (Idleness Limit Exceeded)** - The program performed no operations for a prolonged period (often due to infinite loops).
- **Skipped** - The submission was skipped due to a higher priority submission being judged (common in contests), or sometimes plagged
- **Running on Test #** - The system is currently evaluating the solution on a specific test case.
