// Find p95th element of continuous stream of integer
/*
The 95th percentile (p95) of a dataset is the value such that 95% of the data points are less than or equal to it, and only 5% of the data points are greater than it, after the data has been sorted in ascending order.
In practical terms, if you sort akk the values and look at the position corresponding to 95% of the total count, the value at that position is the p95.
This metric is commonly used to describe the "typical worst-case" behavior of a system, because it represents how large the values are for almost all observations while ignoring rare extreme outliers.
