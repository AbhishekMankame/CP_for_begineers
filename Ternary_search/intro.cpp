// Ternary Search
/*
Ternary search is a divide and conquer algorithm similar to binary search, but instead of dividing the array into two parts, it divides the array into three parts.

It is typically used for finding the maximum and minimum of a unimodal function, or searching in a sorted array (though binary search is more efficient for arrays).
