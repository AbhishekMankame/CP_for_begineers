## Matrix Rotation

Matrix rotation involves rearranging elements of a matrix to represent a rotation by 90 degree, 180 degree or 270 degree (clockwise or anti-clockwise). It's common operation in:
- Computer graphics
- Image processing
- Game development
- Algorithms & coding interviews

### ðŸ“Œ Assumptions
We usually deal with square matrices (N*N), but rectangular (M*N) matrices can also be rotated using extra space.
