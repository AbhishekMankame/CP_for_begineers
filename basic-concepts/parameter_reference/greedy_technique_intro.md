## ðŸ§ What is the Greedy Technique?
The Greedy technique builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the best (greedy) option at that moment, hoping that this leads to the overall optimal solution.

### ðŸ§© Key Characteristics
| Property | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| Locally Optimal Choice | At each step, pich what seems best right now |
| No Reversals | Once a decision is made, it's never reconsidered |
| No Backtracking | Unlike Dynamic Programming or DFS |
| Works when | Local optimum leads to global optimum (greedy-choice property + optimal substructure) |
