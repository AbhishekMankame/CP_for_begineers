// First and last occurrences of element in sorted array

/* 
To find the first and last occurrences of an element in a sorted array efficiently, we can use binary search.

Why binary search?
- Since the array is sorted, binary search can find positions in O(log n) time.
- Using two variations of binary search we can find the first and last occurrences sepeartely.
