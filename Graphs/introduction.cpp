// Graphs: Introduction
/*Graph is a collection of nodes and edges. It is a data structure that represents relationships between objects. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted. They are used in various applications such as social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation networks.*/

/* Storing a Graph
- Adjacency List
- Adjacency Matrix
- Edge List
- 2D Matrix (Implicit Graph)
*/

/*Disadvantages of Adjacency Matrix
- Too much memory is required
- Just to check the neighbours we need O(v) time to check entire row
*/

/*Types of Graph
- Weighted Graph
- Unweighted Graph
- Undirected Graph
- Directed Graph
*/

// Weighted Graph --> Graphs whose edges or paths have values called weights. Edges value can be represent weight/cost/length

// Unweighted Graph --> There is no value or weight associated with the edge. By default, all the graphs are unweighted unless there is a value associated.

// Directed Graph --> Edges are directed from one node to another. For example, Flights Routes, Flight Fares

// Undirected Graph --> All edges are bi-directional. For example, Friends connected on facebook
