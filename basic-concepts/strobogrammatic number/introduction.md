## What is strobogrammatic number?
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees. These numbers are symmetrical when viewed upside down.
For example, the number 69 is strobogrammatic because, if you rotate it by 180 degree it still reads as 69.

A valid strobogrammatic number is one that when viewed upside down, remains the same. The digits the can be used to form a strobogrammatic numbers are: 0 1 6 8 9
<br> These digits map as follows when rotated 180 degrees
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
6 -> 9
8 -> 8
9 -> 6
<br> Other digits like 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 cannot be part of a strobogrammatic number since they do not map to any valid number when rotated 180 degrees.
