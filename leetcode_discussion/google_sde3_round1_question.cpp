// Google SWE 3 - Round 1 Question
/*
Found in leetcode discussion:
Recently I gave the google interview. This was the question which was asked. Can anyone help me what can be the optimized approach for this?

You are given a set of N unique 2D point coordinates (x,y) on the cartesian plane. Find the number of magical rectangles that can be formed with the given points.

A magical rectangle is an empty rectangular non-zero area parallel to the coordinate axes, delimited only by an upper left point and a lower right point, with no other points or within its area.
