// Graphs: Introduction
/*Graph is a collection of nodes and edges. It is a data structure that represents relationships between objects. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted. They are used in various applications such as social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation networks.*/

/* Storing a Graph
- Adjacency List
- Adjacency Matrix
- Edge List
- 2D Matrix (Implicit Graph)
*/

/*Disadvantages of Adjacency Matrix
- Too much memory is required
- Just to check the neighbours we need O(v) time to check entire row
