/*
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on bits and are fundamental in low-level programming.
They allow manipulation of individual bits within an integer, which can lead to efficient algorithms and optimizations.
Common bitwise operators include AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>).
